    # Todo: For each pixel position [i, j], you need to compute the filtered output: img_filtered[i, j] using a non-local means filter
    # step 1: compute window_sizexwindow_size filter weights of the non-local means filter in terms of intensity_variance. 
    # step 2: compute the filtered pixel img_filtered[i, j] using the obtained kernel weights and the pixel values in the search window
    # Please see slides 30 and 31 of lecture 6. Clarification: the patch_size refers to the size of small image patches (image content in yellow, 
    # red, and blue boxes in the slide 30); intensity_variance denotes sigma^2 in slide 30; the window_size is the size of the search window as illustrated in slide 31.
    # Tip: use zero-padding to address the black border issue.
