recap:
    after applying filter (gaussian filter) to reduce noisy image,
    we encounter a new problem, the image is blurry.

in this class we introduce another filter to solve this issue.

goal of image filtering is to modify pixel in image based on some function of local neighbourhood of each pixel.
